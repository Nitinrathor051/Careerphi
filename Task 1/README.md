Personal Finance Management System
The Personal Finance Management System is a Java-based console application developed during my Java Training and Internship with CareerPhi. It helps users efficiently manage their income, expenses, savings, and transactions.

Features
Add Income & Expenses: Update balance with categorized transactions.

View Financial Summary: Display total income, expenses, and current balance.

Transaction History: Access detailed records with categories.

Financial Insights: Feedback on financial health based on balance.

Key Concepts
Built using OOP principles, it incorporates ArrayLists for dynamic transaction storage, HashMaps for categorization, loops for processing data, and conditional statements for logic.

Usage
Run the application in any Java environment to manage personal finances.

This project highlights core Java concepts and problem-solving skills, laying the foundation for more advanced systems.
